Practical 1

Step 1: Start Hadoop Services

start-dfs.sh
start-yarn.sh


Step 2: Create a Directory in HDFS

hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/hadoop




Step 3: Prepare a Sample Text File

echo "Hello Hadoop. Welcome to Big Data processing with Hadoop." > sample.txt



Step 4: Upload the Sample Text File to HDFS

hdfs dfs -put sample.txt /user/hadoop/



Step 5: Verify the Upload

hdfs dfs -ls /user/hadoop/



Step 6: Run a MapReduce Job

hadoop jar /usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-*.jar wordcount /user/hadoop/sample.txt /user/hadoop/output


Step 7: View the Output

hdfs dfs -cat /user/hadoop/output/part-r-00000




Step 9: Clean Up HDFS

# Remove the directory containing the output of the MapReduce job
hdfs dfs -rm -r /user/hadoop/output

# Optionally, remove the sample text file if it is no longer needed
hdfs dfs -rm /user/hadoop/sample.txt



Step 10: Start Hadoop Services

stop-dfs.sh
stop-yarn.sh






Practical 2


Step 1: Start Hadoop Services

start-dfs.sh
start-yarn.sh


Step 2: Run the Pi Estimator Job

hadoop jar /usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-*.jar pi 16 1000000
